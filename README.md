# Pig-game
My first simple game! I have been learning a lot from Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course and after completing some parts of the course I just finished making this simple Pig game. He is a very good teacher.

Rules of this Pig game:
1. You need to roll the dice to accumulate the current scores.
2. If you press the Hold button, then the current scores will be added/saved to the permanent score and the dice will be shifted to the 2nd player.
3. While you are accumulating the current scores, if your dice is "1", you will lose all the current scores that you accumulated. (Not your permanent scores)
4. Whoever can make 100 permanent scores first, will win.
